\begin{abstract}
People determine their train schedules under the assumption of no train delays. However, in 2023, when the Deutsche Bahn (DB) announced that its punctuality quote fell to 65.2 percent in 2022, this assumption becomes problematic. In this paper, we conduct route optimization to find the most reliable route going from Stuttgart to Frankfurt (Main). Additionally, we analyze factors influencing train delays and support our claim by visualizing them and modeling a random forest. We found that the optimal route has less than half of the mean delay of the fastest route that Deutsche Bahn offers. The most influencing factors of train delay were the route's distance to the border of Germany, the (relative) number of train rides and the between centrality.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
If a group of Tübinger students would want to take a trip to Frankfurt (Main) by train, there are many possible routes to take. Would they be able to decide beforehand on the most reliable route and the best time to go?

When traveling from one place to another by Deutsche Bahn, passengers often can't rely on arriving at their destination at the scheduled time. Even though real-time train delay is provided by the Deutsche Bahn, informing travelers about current delays, passengers don't have any information about the delay beforehand. Deutsche Bahn is able to identify the fastest route, without considering the mean delay of this route (e.g., \href{https://www.bahn.de/buchung/intern/start}{travel information}). Previous studies often focused on predicting train delay \cite{predtraindelay, largetrainnet, MLtraindel}. Our goal is to identify the most reliable train route going from Stuttgart to Frankfurt (Main).

To analyze the most reliable route, we followed two approaches: route optimization (\Cref{sec:methods_route}) and analysing external influences (\Cref{sec:methods_ext}). The first approach is to find all possible routes going from Stuttgart to Frankfurt (Main) and then identifying the route with the least mean delay (i.e., the most reliable route). Here, we found that the optimal route differs from the fastest route that Deutsche Bahn offers. The second approach is to investigate whether the day of the week, month, season, or holiday impact the delay. Here, we found several factors influencing the delay.

Our study aims to fill a gap in train delay research by shifting the focus from predicting delays to informing passengers beforehand about the most reliable route and the best time to go. This enables passengers to make informed decision about their journeys, so that they can pick the optimal route with confidence and without solely relying on taking the fastest route.


\section{Data and Methods}\label{sec:methods}

We are working with \href{https://data.deutschebahn.com/dataset/ist-verkehrsdaten-der-db-cargo-auf-bst8-ebene.html}{train delay data} provided by the Deutsche Bahn, that consists of stations and stops that measured the number of trains and minutes of delay of all trains passing by in 2016. We are also using the \href{https://data.deutschebahn.com/dataset/betriebsstellen-gueterverkehr.html}{directory of operating sites}, containing the names and coordinates of the stations. For geographical information on routes of the rail transport network, we used \href{https://data.deutschebahn.com/dataset/betriebsstellen-gueterverkehr.html}{geographical route data}. Our train delay data consists of 757 007 entries, measuring the delay all over Germany throughout the year 2016. Figure 1 shows an overview of all stops and stations and their mean delay in 2016. The mean delay of all Germany in 2016 was 34.84 minutes. After merging all three datasets, our data consists of information about the stations and stops, their time stamp, their geographical data, their corresponding nearest routes and further information about the rails (e.g., railroad type, number of rails, speed limit or electrification).

\subsection{Route Optimization}\label{sec:methods_route}

Our first approach is to find the optimal route from Stuttgart to Frankfurt (Main) (i.e., the route with the least mean delay). To do so, we first got all continuous routes that exist in Germany (\href{https://data.deutschebahn.com/dataset/betriebsstellen-gueterverkehr.html}{geographical route data}). We started by finding all routes that have a starting point in Stuttgart. Going from here, we found all adjacent routes that connect to these starting routes. We repeatedly found adjacent routes until we found all possible routes, starting in Stuttgart and terminating in Frankfurt (Main). Next, we connected the route data to the data containing the mean delay, measured by stops and stations. This was conducted by assigning the stops or stations to the route to which it has a distance that is less or equal to 0.01 latitudes or longitudes. This translates to a maximum distance to the matching route of about 0.7 to 1.11 km, depending on the specific latitude or longitude. Lastly, we calculated the mean delay per each possible route and found the route with the least mean delay.

In order to compare our optimal route with the fastest route that Deutsche Bahn suggests, we collected all the stations that are included in the fastest route by hand. We also calculated the mean delay for this route.

\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

\subsection{Route Optimization}\label{sec:results_route}

We found 108 unique routes, all starting in Stuttgart and ending in Frankfurt (Main). The optimal route with the least mean delay included five unique pieces of trail tracks and included 42 stations or stops. The mean delay for our optimal route is 14.19 minutes. The fastest route by Deutsche Bahn contains 46 stations or stops with a mean delay of 35.65 minutes. Figure 2 displays a comparison of both routes. More visualizations and the code can be found in our \href{https://github.com/frederikpanse/db_project}{github repository}.

\section{Discussion \& Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

The aim of our study was to find the most reliable route from Stuttgart to Frankfurt (Main). To do so, we conducted route optimization and proposed an optimized route that has less than half of the mean delay than the fastest route by Deutsche Bahn. In addition to that, we analyzed external factors that might influence train delay and found that the route's distance to the border of Germany, the (relative) number of train rides and the between centrality influence train delay the most.

It is necessary to consider factors beyond simple travel time, such as the operational schedules of other trains and the centrality of specific stations depending on date train system. Additionally, DB operators should consider these factors when deciding train routes and schedules. Centrality metrics and capacity of train stations can be applied to train systems. Future research should explore the interconnectivity between shortest path under the assumption of no delays and probability of delay.

Still, there are some limitations to our work. We only considered data from 2016, which might be outdated in 2024. The data we used had missing values. For example, there was more data available for weekdays than for weekends, which might influence our results. In addition to that, we only did route optimization for the route from Stuttgart to Frankfurt (Main) and did not create a universal tool for reliable routes.

The delays were computed on a daily average basis, potentially leading to varying results based on different time intervals. Furthermore, our analysis exclusively focused on delay times. A more comprehensive understanding could be achieved by constructing a model that considers both travel time and the probability of delays. The data from the database is incomplete, incorporating only about 35.31\% of the available records for Random Forest model development. Specifically, we considered data from stations with records available for at least 288 days, accounting for over 90\% of this period. Stations with no reported delays throughout the entire duration were excluded from the dataset.

However, our results propose that there are more reliable routes than the routes that are already provided by Deutsche Bahn. The identification of factors influencing the train delay enables passengers to knowingly decide on the optimal route to go from Stuttgart to Frankfurt (Main).

\section{Analysis of Factors Influencing Delays}

In this section, we will provide comprehensive information on factors influencing train delays by examining the results of visualizations and random forest modeling together. We aim to present a detailed analysis of the factors contributing to train delays.

The dataset used in this study is characterized by a significant imbalance, with a large proportion of non-delayed data. To tackle this, downsampling was applied, focusing on the count of delayed instances. Correlation calculations were then carried out using train stations as reference points, and only data with correlations surpassing a specific threshold were retained. The accuracy of the random forest model is 0.8229.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{fig/plot_JH_feature_importance.pdf}
    \caption{Feature Importance of Random Forest}
    \label{fig:enter-label}
\end{figure}

\subsection{{Centrality Measures}}

After calculating the correlation coefficients related to the delay times between stations, we created edges between two stations if the correlation coefficient was 0.4 or higher. The importance of variables in terms of between centrality was found to be very high, despite being a virtual relationship based on the correlation patterns of delay, rather than a physical connection.


The betweenness centrality ($C_B(v)$) of a node $v$ in a graph is calculated as the sum of the fraction of all pairs of nodes $(s, t)$, where $s \neq v \neq t$, for which node $v$ lies on the shortest path between $s$ and $t$. The formula for betweenness centrality is given by:

\begin{equation}
C_B(v) = \sum_{s \neq v \neq t} \frac{\sigma_{st}(v)}{\sigma_{st}}
\end{equation}

Here, $\sigma_{st}$ represents the total number of shortest paths from node $s$ to node $t$, and $\sigma_{st}(v)$ represents the number of those paths that pass through node $v$.

This measure provides an indication of how central a node is in terms of facilitating communication between other nodes in the network.

The second centrality measure is closeness centrality. The closeness centrality ($C_C(v)$) of a node $v$ in a graph is a measure of how close it is to all other nodes in the network. It is defined as the reciprocal of the average shortest path distance from node $v$ to all other nodes. According to Ulrik \cite{generic_comp}, the formula for closeness centrality is given by:

\begin{equation}
C_C(v) = \frac{1}{\sum_{u} d(v, u)}
\end{equation}

Here, $d(v, u)$ represents the shortest path distance from node $v$ to node $u$, and the sum is taken over all other nodes in the network.

Closeness centrality reflects how efficiently a node can communicate with other nodes in the network, emphasizing nodes that are closer to all other nodes.




As argued by Freeman \cite{betweenness}, betweenness centrality is one of the most important indicators for a vertex or node because it refers to the extent of the vertex that is structurally central for standing in between others and the vertex can therefore facilitate or impede the transmission of information/goods \cite{centrality}.

betweenness centrality can serve as a very useful tool for rail operators to plan their maintenance schedule because the more ‘central’ stations experience much more stress, resulting in high loadings on its facilities \cite{centrality}.

\subsection{{characteristics of station}}

We considered three factors related to train stations, listed in order of variable importance: distance from the border, the ratio of the given date's train rides to the median of the usual train rides (Relative number of train rides), and the number of train rides. Within the choropleth map (Figure 1), it was evident that significant delays occurred near the border. Additionally, the Relative number of train rides measures the likelihood of delays if the train station exceeds its capacity to handle train operations.

\subsection{{Factors related to dates}}

We analyzed the delays based on factors related to dates, including Day, Month, Dayofweek, and Holidays.
